## How to Embed a YouTube Video

Replace the `VIDEO_ID` with your YouTube video id (the part after `v=`) and place this in a `.qmd` file:

```{=html}
<iframe width="800" height="450"
  src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VIDEO_ID"
  title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0"
  allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
  allowfullscreen></iframe>
```

> Tip: you can also use a pure Markdown link like  
> `https://youtu.be/VIDEO_ID` — most themes will auto-embed.
